-- colections of all github concepts I use
### collaborating well and effectively
we clone the repository creating a copy of it on my machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git #this is the link to remote
cd repository-name
```
then we branch from main to another branch we create
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name # small features per branch eg "add-login-page"
# The branch will be switched from main to this branch we have created.

```
then we push the branch to remote for tracking
```bash
git push -u origin feature-branch-name

```

make some changes on that branch then do the necessary
```bash
git status

git add . # or git add filenamechanged

git commit -m "Added a login form" # message saying what you did
 
# then push
git push origin feature-branch-name # good so you specify well

# Also this is acceptable

git push

```
Once your changes are pushed, you need to create a pull request so others can review and merge your changes.


1. **Go to GitHub (or your Git hosting platform)** and navigate to your repository.
2. You'll often see a banner prompting you to create a pull request for the branch you just pushed. Click on **"Compare & pull request"**.
3. Add a **title** and **description** of the changes in the PR form.
4. Select the branch you want to merge your changes into (usually `main` or `develop`).
5. **Submit the pull request** for review.

### **Code Review and Discussion**

Once the pull request is created, your team members will be able to:

- **Review the code**: They will leave comments, feedback, or approve the changes.
- **Request changes**: If there are issues with your code, they might request changes. You can continue working on the same branch to fix any issues.

### **Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any)**

If there are conflicting changes between your branch and the base branch (usually `main`), you'll need to resolve them before your pull request can be merged.

**Pull the latest changes from the base branch (e.g., `main`)**:

```bash
git checkout main # also git switch main can be used
git pull origin main # git pull also works if you are in the branch you want to pull to
# but explicitly saying the branch name is good
```

Switch back to your feature-branch
```bash
git checkout feature-branch-name # still git switch feature-branch-name
```

merge the latest `main` changes into your branch
```bash
git merge main
```
**Resolve any conflicts** manually in the affected files. Git will mark the conflicts, and you'll need to decide how to merge them.

**Stage and commit the resolved files**:
```bash
git add conflicted-file
git commit -m "Resolved Merge Commit"
```
**Push the updated branch**
```bash
git push origin feature-branch-name
```
### Merge the Pull Request**

After your pull request is approved and all conflicts are resolved, itâ€™s time to merge it into the main branch.

1. If you're the one handling the PR, you can merge it yourself by clicking the **"Merge pull request"** button on GitHub.
2. If someone else is reviewing, they will merge it once they approve.

Once the PR is merged, you can **delete your feature branch** both locally and remotely to keep the repository clean:

Delete locally

```bash
git branch -b feature-branch-name
```
Deleting remotely
```bash
git push origin --delete feature-branch-name
```
Pull regularly before anything
